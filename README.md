## How To Use

- ### Home
 It shows all flights in a specific Formula which is *(From -airport- To -airport- #-number-)*. I used the *hover selector*  on *-airport-* and *#-number-* because it will make it easier to distinguish.

 - When user clicks on:

   - *-airport-*: he will get redirected to this specific airport page, it shows all flights from and to this airport.

    - *#number*: he will get redirected to that flight page, he can book a seat or cancel booking, and he can see the passengers number on this flights


- ### Airports
  It shows all airports with their **IATA** code, and by clicking on the airport name he will be redirected to this airport page

- ### My Flights
  It shows the flights that user has booked on
